This is the optional lab from the course Machine Learning in Production, taught by Andrew NG.

In this project we create a dataset of cats, dogs, and bird.
Then we split the data with 70% to train the model, and the rest into the dev set, to check the model on.

Lastly, we perform some metrics to deduce the results and showcase them using matplotlib.
